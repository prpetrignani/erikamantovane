            <p>
                Since 2018 I have worked as a Product Manager for the Tommaso Cardullo firm.
                During the year I helped create a network of artisans who make Italian made-to-measure clothing for American customers.
                I have designed a couple of clothes and followed the creation of samples and their effectiveness.
                I also manage all the orders, do fabric research, and help with stylistic decisions when needed.
